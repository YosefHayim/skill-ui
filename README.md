# planpage

Render an agent's **plan, review-gate, or report** as a beautiful, self-contained **local HTML page** — authored as Preact components rendered to static HTML, with an opt-in post-back server so the browser can hand a decision back to your agent. Like mcp-ui, but for local terminal skills.

Built for skill and agent authors — and the developers who read what an agent proposes. Reader-first: the design center is the person *reading* the plan.

## Quick start

```bash
npx planpage                                       # interactive menu (in a TTY)
npx planpage render plan-brief --sample --open     # render a full sample plan and open it
```

No install needed — `npx` fetches it. `render … --sample --open` writes a self-contained HTML file and opens it in your browser, so you see the output in one command. Requires Node 18+.

## Usage

Three ways in, one render engine underneath.

### CLI

```bash
planpage render <template> --data plan.json --open       # render a template to HTML
planpage render <template> --serve --decision out.json   # render + collect one decision (post-back)
planpage serve page.html out.json                        # serve an existing HTML file, collect a decision
planpage library --open                                  # the living component gallery
planpage new my-template                                 # scaffold a new template folder
planpage capture                                         # check the gallery registry is in sync
planpage init                                            # wire planpage into your agents (claude, cursor, codex)
planpage                                                 # (bare, in a TTY) interactive menu
```

Templates: `plan-brief` · `before-after` · `code-style-plan`. Data goes in as JSON via `--data <file>` or piped stdin; `--sample` uses built-in sample data; `planpage render <template> --help` prints the shape.

### Library

```tsx
import { render, BeforeAfter } from "planpage";

const html = render(
  <BeforeAfter
    title="Deslop pass"
    diffs={[{ file: "src/x.ts", before: "let x = 1", after: "const x = 1" }]}
  />,
);
// `html` is a complete HTML document string — write it, open it, or serve it.
```

### In your agent

planpage is a package + CLI — **not itself a skill**. One command wires it into whatever agent you use, writing a small, idempotent on-ramp per agent that tells it to render the plan gate through `npx planpage` and read the decision back:

```bash
npx planpage init                  # scaffold on-ramps for Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex
npx planpage init --agent cursor   # just one (claude | cursor | codex | all)
npx planpage init --global         # put the Claude skill in ~/.claude/skills (user-wide)
```

| Agent | What it writes |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | a `render-plan` skill at `.claude/skills/render-plan/SKILL.md` |
| **Cursor** | a project rule at `.cursor/rules/planpage.mdc` |
| **Codex** | a delimited block appended to `AGENTS.md` (never clobbers what's there) |

Prefer to wire it by hand? Drop this into your agent's rules file:

> When you present a plan or review-gate for approval, render it through the `planpage` package instead of dumping text: shape it as JSON for `plan-brief`, run `npx planpage render plan-brief --data plan.json --serve --decision decision.json` (opens the browser, blocks until Approve/Adjust, never hangs a non-TTY caller), then read `decision.json` — `{ approved, flips, revisit, notes }` — and act on it.

The layering is **install the package → `init` an on-ramp that calls it → ship it with your agent**.

## What's inside

**Templates** — whole-page layouts:

- **plan-brief** — an entire agent plan on one page: summary · notes · steps · options · risks · annotated code (the flagship).
- **before-after** — green/red before→after diffs (the workhorse report).
- **code-style-plan** — a pick-the-code gallery + canonical example + CLI flow (an interactive gate).
- **library** — the living, auto-captured component gallery (`planpage library`).

**Components** — reader-first pieces you compose into a page: `Callout` · `RiskList` · `Steps` · `Timeline` · `StatusChip` · `OptionCompare` · `PickBlock` · `PlanSummary` · `CodeBlock` · `DiffBlock` · `AnnotatedCode` · `SectionCard` · `Accordion` · `TreePanel` · `Flow` (Mermaid). Every one is showcased live — run `planpage library --open`.

## How it works

```
data → render() → HTML string → (write / open)  OR  (serve → one decision back)
```

A static render is the floor; the post-back server is opt-in and never hangs a non-TTY caller. Everything is self-contained — Tailwind + Mermaid load from CDN, and nothing is written into your repo.

## Scope

- **Static-beautiful first, interactive by opt-in.** A page reads well with zero JavaScript; islands (the post-back, the gallery filter) are added only when asked for.
- **Local HTML, not a hosted app.** planpage renders a file you open — it is not a server framework or a client-side React app.
- **Not mcp-ui / MCP Apps.** Those own the protocol and host lane; planpage renders local pages for terminal skills.
- **Not itself a skill.** It is the engine; `planpage init` wires it into your agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex).
